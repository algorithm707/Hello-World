# Hello-World
Hi guys,

I have experience with data structures/algorithm design, GUI database development, Graph coloring/scheduling, system programming and multiprocessing on Linux/Unix platform as well as web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript/ PHP. My past projects include linux shell, graph coloring, java database app, python game and web development.
